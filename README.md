# Library System Design using C++
This repository contains the final project for the UML course in ITI 9-Month Scholarship. The library system is designed using C++ and uses object-oriented programming concepts. It has a command-line interface for the user to interact with the system.

### Class Diagram
The class diagram shows the classes and their relationships in the library system. It illustrates how the classes inherit from each other and how they are associated. The main classes in the system are Person, Customer, Librarian, and Book.

### Activity Diagram
The activity diagram shows the flow of activities in the library system. It illustrates how the system processes requests and performs actions. The system allows customers and librarians to login or register, search for books, borrow or lend books, add or delete books, update books, and generate reports.

### Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram shows the actors and the use cases in the library system. It illustrates how the system is used by different actors and the different actions they can perform. The system has two main actors, the customer and the librarian, each with their own set of actions they can perform.

### Interaction Diagram
The interaction diagram shows the interactions between the objects in the library system. It illustrates how the objects communicate with each other and how they collaborate to perform actions. The system uses several data structures such as vectors, unordered_maps and unordered_sets to store and manage the data.
